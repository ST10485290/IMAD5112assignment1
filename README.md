Food Suggestor App "FOOD STOP"

I've created a quick and easy to use food app that gives variety food choices to users that may need help with meal planning through out the day. How does the app work ? Well the user has to enter time of day for an example
, morning ,mid-morning, afternoon , mid- afternoon and dinner to get the suggested meals. The suggested meals will only be displayed right after clicking or pressing on the Submit button.
When its a different time of the day, the user must click on the Reset button so that the app can allow them to enter a different time of the day and get the meal that is suitable for that time of the day.
